## About Me

Hey there! I'm Pavithraa — a Computer Science undergrad who’s genuinely curious about how things work and even more curious about how to make them work better. I'm passionate about building end-to-end systems, whether that's on the web or closer to the metal.

### A few things about me:
- I enjoy full-stack development as much as I enjoy debugging embedded code at 2am.  
- Currently looking for a **Summer 2025 internship** to get hands-on with real-world problems (and maybe break a few things before fixing them better).  
- Communication is my secret sauce — I love writing clean code *and* clear documentation (yes, I exist).  
- Always up for learning something new or working on a cool side project — ping me if you have one!
